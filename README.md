Goal: The objective of this project is to collaboratively design, build, and deploy a dynamic website featuring some of the worldâ€™s most popular games. Through this project, our team aims to strengthen our full-stack development skills by implementing a variety of modern web technologies across both frontend and backend. Additionally, we seek to gain practical experience in project planning, version control, and agile teamwork within a real-world development environment. This website will serve as both a portfolio piece and a learning opportunity, showcasing our ability to create engaging, interactive web applications from concept to deployment.

### JS vs JSX 
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It introduces XML-like tags and attributes to create React elements. JS, on the other hand, is plain JavaScript code without any special syntax or extensions.
